# Inventory Management System

The application I am designing for my project is an inventory management system, allowing users to easily track stock, sales, and product information. This application will be used by business owners involved in the sale of merchandise. It is of interest to me since my Uncle owns a shop and I would often see him manually tracking the sale of goods. Hence, I thought of developing an application that would make doing such things easier.
