# Inventory Management System

The application I am designing for my project is an inventory management system, allowing users to easily track stock, sales, and product information. This application will be used by business owners involved in the sale of merchandise. It is of interest to me since my Uncle owns a shop and I would often see him manually tracking the sale of goods. Hence, I thought of developing an application that would make doing such things easier.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to see the details of all the items currently in inventory
- As a user, I want to be able to add a new product to the current inventory of products
- As a user, I want to be able to change the quantity of products in my inventory, by restocking or selling them
- As a user, I want to be able to know when to restock products as their quantity becomes low
- As a user, I want to be able to view the amount of money I made in sales
- As a user, I want to be able to set discounts that are applied when selling products
- As a user, I want to be able to load inventory data from a previous save
- As a user, I want to be able to save data before exiting the application
